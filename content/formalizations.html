<h1>Selected formalization projects</h1>
<p>
Formalizations in Naproche are often carried out by <!--bachelor and master--> students
as part of a practical project or a thesis.
On this page we present some of the larger formalizations projects in Naproche.
Please note that some formalizations only run in the respective contemporary version of Naproche.

<h2>Perfectoid rings</h2>
<p>
Perfectoid rings are main components of perfectoid spaces. Perfectoid rings were formalized
within the celebrated formalization of perfectoid spaces in Lean by K. Buzzard,
J. Commelin, and P. Massot. We present a self-contained Naproche formalization of perfectoid
rings which partly follows the Lean formalization. Our
<a href="https://github.com/naproche/FLib/blob/master/PerfectoidRings/perfectoidrings.ftl.tex">formalization</a>
can be proofchecked in <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2024/">Isabelle 2024</a>
and read as a
<a href="https://github.com/naproche/FLib/blob/master/PerfectoidRings/perfectoidrings.ftl.pdf">pdf file</a>.

<h2>Selection of Wiedijk’s 100 theorems</h2>
<p>
In the summer semester of 2023 Peter Koepke, Mateusz Marcol, and Patrick Schäfer
formalized some of <a href="https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/">Wiedijk’s 100 theorems</a>
and compiled them together with existing formalizations into a continuous document.
The formalization is part of the examples that ship with Naproche in the Isabelle (September 2023) distribution.
This work was presented at <a href="https://europroofnet.github.io/cambridge-2023/#koepke1">NatFoM 2023</a>.

<h2>Solow growth model </h2>
<p>In 1956, Robert M. Solow published a mathematical theory which describes  capital accumulation, technological advancements, and population growth. The Solow model is widely used in economics to this day. The formalization encompasses the model as well as its mathematical foundations from real analysis. This is the first formalization of an economic model which is also readable like an ordinary mathematical text. The formalization can be downloaded <a href="solow.zip">here</a>.

<h2>Initial chapters of Rudin’s <i>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</i></h2>
<p>
In 2022 <a href="https://github.com/naproche/real-analysis/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS">ten students</a> formalized the first five chapters of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Mathematical_Analysis"><i>Baby Rudin</i></a> while staying as close to the original text as possible. The formalization is available <a href="https://github.com/naproche/real-analysis">here</a>.

<h2>Set theory up to Silver’s theorem</h2>
<p>
In 2020 Jan Penquitt formalized <a href="https://github.com/naproche/FLib/tree/master/SetTheory">set theory</a> in Naproche up to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X76900029">Silver’s theorem</a> about the continuum function at singular cardinals of uncountable cofinality.
This formalization was also

</p>

<h2>Linear algebra and representation theory</h2>
<p>
In 2020 Erik Sturzenhecker formalized <a href="https://github.com/naproche/FLib/tree/master/linear_algebra_ftl">linear algebra</a> and <a href="https://github.com/naproche/FLib/tree/master/RepresentationTheory">representation theory</a> in Naproche.
