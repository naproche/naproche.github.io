    Naproche is distributed as part of
    <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/">Isabelle</a>,
    with downloads available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    Naproche uses Isabelle’s integrated development environment and its bundled automated provers,
    but is unconnected to Isabelle’s <!--meta and object--> logics.
</p>
<p>
    On macOS, when first opening Isabelle, you may need to control-click the <code>.app</code> bundle and select “Open” to bypass Apple’s Gatekeeper. You will find a short introduction to Naproche in the Examples section of the Documentation panel on the left of the IDE.
    Opening a ForTheL file in ASCII format (<code>.ftl</code>) or LaTeX format
    (<code>.ftl.tex</code>) in the Isabelle/jEdit editor will automatically
    invoke its continuous checking by Naproche.
</p>
<p>
    Naproche is open source and its source code is freely available <a href="https://github.com/naproche/naproche">on GitHub</a>.
